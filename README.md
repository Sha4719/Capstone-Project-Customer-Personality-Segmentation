# Customer Personality Segmentation

**Course:** Making Sense of Unstructured Data  
**Project Type:** Unsupervised Machine Learning | Customer Analytics

## Project Overview

This project focuses on segmenting customers based on their behaviors and demographics using unsupervised machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to help businesses develop targeted marketing strategies, enhance customer retention for high-value segments, and optimize resource allocation—including inventory management, pricing, and store layout design.

As a data scientist, I was tasked with analyzing structured customer data, applying clustering algorithms, and extracting actionable insights to support business decision-making.

## Methodology

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Handled missing values and outliers  
   - Performed univariate and multivariate analysis  
   - Visualized feature distributions to understand customer patterns  

2. **Feature Engineering & Scaling:**  
   - Normalized numerical features  
   - Encoded categorical features  
   - Applied dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA) to capture latent patterns

3. **Clustering:**  
   - Applied K-Means clustering to identify distinct customer groups  
   - Determined optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score  
   - Interpreted cluster characteristics to inform business strategies
